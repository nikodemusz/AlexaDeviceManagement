# Changelog

## 0.4.0

- **Breaking**: Removed HA custom integration (`custom_components`). This is now a
  pure standalone HA OS add-on/app with its own web UI – no HA integration required.
- Removed `hacs.json` and all integration code (config_flow, websocket_api, panel, etc.)
- Removed `map: config:rw` – the app no longer writes to the HA config directory.
- The app is a self-contained web application accessible via HA ingress sidebar panel.

## 0.3.0

- Add Amazon Alexa authentication configuration (client_id, client_secret, refresh_token, region).
- Add ingress web UI to display Alexa devices.
- Web server powered by aiohttp serves a device overview panel.
- Configuration status shown in the UI (configured vs. not configured).

## 0.2.0

- Add Home Assistant App Installer support for Alexa Device Management.
